        <h2>Relational Database</h2>
        <p>A relational database, invented by E.F. Codd at IBM in 1970, is a tabular database in which data is organized so that it can be reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways. It is made up of a set of tables with data that fits into predefined categories. Each table has one data category in a column, and each row represents a certain instance of data for the category defined in the column. The standard user and application program interface for relational databases is Structured Query Language (SQL). Relational databases are easy to extend, and new data categories can be added after the original database creation without modifying all the existing applications.</p>

        <h2>Distributed Database</h2>
        <p>In a distributed database, portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations and executed, dispersed, or replicated among different points in a network. Distributed databases can be heterogeneous or homogeneous. All physical locations in a homogeneous distributed database have the same underlying hardware and run the same operating system and database application, while the hardware or database application in a heterogeneous distributed database can be different at each location.</p>

        <h2>Cloud Database</h2>
        <p>A cloud database is a database that has been optimized or built for virtualizing the environment, either in a hybrid cloud, public cloud, or private cloud. Cloud databases provide benefits such as the ability to scale storage capacity and bandwidth on a pay-per-use basis and provide scalability on demand, along with high availability. A cloud database also gives users the opportunity to support business applications in a software-as-a-service deployment.</p>

        <h2>NoSQL Database</h2>
        <p>NoSQL databases are useful for large sets of distributed data. They are effective for big data performance issues that relational databases cannot solve. They are most effective when an organization must analyze large chunks of unstructured data or data stored across multiple virtual servers in the cloud.</p>
